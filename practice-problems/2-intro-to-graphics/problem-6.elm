-- Starting with this example (http://elm-lang.org/edit/examples/Intermediate/Physics.elm), change the orbit of the Earth. Part of programming is working with code that you do not understand entirely. Do not be afraid!

# Physics: How does it work?

Today we are going to learn how to gravity.

Now that we can gravity, let's see if we can do it with elasticity!

outro = [markdown|
Now you know how to gravity with elasticity! Good work physics friend!
