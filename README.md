# Elm Fun

This is just a repository for me to play around with the [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) language and do some of the practice problems from the official website.

## Why Learning Elm

I heard that it's a great first language to learn [Functional Reactive Programming](http://elm-lang.org/learn/What-is-FRP.elm).

## Folder Architecture

1. `practice-problems/` contains my answers to the exercices from the official website
1. `projects/` contains a few small projects I tried to create using only Elm

## Testing The Files

1. Install [elm-platform](https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-platform#installers)
1. Run `elm-reactor` at the root of this repository and browse http://localhost:8000
